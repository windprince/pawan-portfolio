# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Deploy Your Portfolio

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/windprince) and click "New repository"
2. **Repository name**: `pawan-portfolio`
3. **Description**: `Professional portfolio showcasing clinical expertise and AI innovation`
4. Make it **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Upload Your Portfolio Files

You have two options:

#### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. After creating the repository, GitHub will show you an empty repository page
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop ALL files from your `/app/frontend/` folder EXCEPT:
   - `node_modules/` folder
   - `.git/` folder (if it exists)
4. Write a commit message: "Initial portfolio upload"
5. Click "Commit changes"

#### Option B: Using Git Commands (if you have Git installed)
```bash
cd /app/frontend
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio upload"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/windprince/pawan-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/windprince/pawan-portfolio`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose branch: **gh-pages** (you might need to create this first by deploying)
6. Click **Save**

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

After uploading files, run the deployment:

#### If you have the repository locally:
```bash
cd /app/frontend
yarn deploy
```

#### If you're using GitHub web interface:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You might need to enable GitHub Actions
3. Create a new workflow file or trigger a deployment manually

### 5. Access Your Live Portfolio

After successful deployment (takes 5-10 minutes):
- **Your portfolio will be live at**: `https://windprince.github.io/pawan-portfolio`

### 6. LinkedIn Sharing

Once live, you can:
1. **Share the URL**: Post the link directly on LinkedIn
2. **Create a post**: "Excited to share my professional portfolio showcasing 25+ years in healthcare technology and my recent AI journey: [URL]"
3. **Write an article**: Detail your AI transformation story with the portfolio as a call-to-action

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If the page doesn't load:**
- Wait 10-15 minutes (GitHub Pages can be slow)
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Ensure the repository is public

**If styling looks broken:**
- Verify the homepage URL in package.json matches your repository name
- Clear browser cache and try again

**If you need to make updates:**
1. Edit files in your repository
2. Commit changes
3. Run `yarn deploy` again (or push to trigger auto-deployment)
